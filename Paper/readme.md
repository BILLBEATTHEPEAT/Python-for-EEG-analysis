**This is a collection of useful papers in EEG signal analysis.**  

The papers may not be the most cited ones or those published by the top journal/conference, but I did extracted some useful ideas from them.  

I wrote down some comments on each paper I have read on my personal website [here](https://billbeatthepeat.github.io/2017/08/24/My-Currently-Reading-Paper/).  

I am still a novel student in the Machine Learning field, so there would be some mistakes or misunderstanding. Kindly contact me with any questions.

Regards.
